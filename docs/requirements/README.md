# Requirements & Screenshots

Drop the requirement screenshots you upload into this folder.

Also see the extracted baseline spec (from the screenshots):

- `odoo-gear-guard-spec.md`

Recommended naming:

- `req-01-overview.png`
- `req-02-kanban.png`
- `req-03-calendar.png`
- `req-04-smart-buttons.png`
- `req-05-scrap-workflow.png`

Once the files are here, I can do a strict requirement-by-requirement audit against the implementation and patch any gaps.

## How to save uploads here

This chat can _view_ the images, but it can’t directly write binary image files into the workspace.

To save them permanently in the repo:

1. Right-click the image in chat and choose **Save image as…**
2. Save into this folder: `docs/requirements/`
3. Keep the recommended filenames above.
